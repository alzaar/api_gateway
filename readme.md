# API Gateway

### Features

1.Request Routing

- Forward incoming API requests to the appropriate backend services based on the URL path or headers.

    2.	Authentication & Authorization
    •	Validate user credentials using JWT, OAuth2, or API keys.
    •	Ensure users and services have access only to authorized resources.
    3.	Rate Limiting
    •	Limit the number of requests per user or IP to prevent abuse.
    •	Implement distributed rate limiting using Redis.
    4.	Caching
    •	Cache responses to reduce backend load and improve response times.
    •	Use tools like Redis or in-memory caching libraries.
    5.	Load Balancing
    •	Distribute traffic evenly across multiple backend servers for scalability and reliability.
    6.	Monitoring & Logging
    •	Log request details, errors, and performance metrics.
    •	Integrate with tools like Winston, DataDog, or New Relic.
    7.	Request Transformation
    •	Modify incoming requests and outgoing responses (e.g., add headers, convert data formats).

    Additional Features
    1.	Service Discovery
    •	Automatically discover backend services using tools like Consul or Eureka.
    2.	Error Handling
    •	Implement centralized error handling for consistent error responses across services.
    3.	SSL Termination
    •	Handle SSL/TLS encryption at the gateway level to offload this responsibility from backend services.
    4.	WebSocket Support
    •	Enable support for real-time communication protocols.
    5.	API Versioning
    •	Manage multiple API versions to maintain backward compatibility.
    6.	Custom Middleware
    •	Add middleware for additional functionalities like request validation or analytics.
    7.	Multi-tenancy
    •	Handle multi-tenant environments by isolating requests and resources for different tenants.

    Development Features
    1.	Hot Reloading
    •	Use tools like nodemon for development to restart the gateway automatically on code changes.
    2.	Unit and Integration Testing
    •	Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha for comprehensive test coverage.
